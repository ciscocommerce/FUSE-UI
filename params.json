{"name":"Project Fuse","tagline":"Creating a single framework from a single source.","body":"###Welcome to Project Fuse.\r\nThe UX team has created a common CCW framework using Bootstrap. We have customized the components provided by Bootstrap to build our CCW pages with the correct styling, layouts, and different components. These templates are meant to bring value for our teams to promote consistency, decrease coding efforts, and reduce page rework. This page provides one place for the framework and components to be housed and downloaded as engineering builds the pages.\r\n\r\n###Our Templates\r\nThe templates can be found on this page and can be downloaded as a ZIP file. We have consolidated all needed UI components. This Zip File contains our resultant framework. It is advised to fork off from this framework and recommit here when more developments are made while building CCW.\r\n\r\n###Authors and Contributors\r\nThe UX team has created this framework and all components included: Mary Williams (@marywill), Chuan Tsay (@chuantsay), Taryn Esperas (@taryn808), and Caresse Hansen (@carhanse)\r\n\r\n###Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our documentation or contact support and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://gist.github.com/2059.js\"></script>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
